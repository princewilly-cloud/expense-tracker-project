# Full-Stack Application with  Node.js, Express, Prisma, and MySQL

## Objective:
Develop a full-stack web application that consists of a Node.js/Express backend utilizing Prisma to interact with a single-table MySQL database. The client-side will be a plain HTML, JavaScript, and CSS web application that interfaces with the API.

## API (Node.js/Express and Prisma):
 - Place your API code within an api folder.
 - Use Prisma as the ORM to facilitate database operations.
 - The database should consist of only one table.
 - Implement CRUD operations for the MySQL database.
 - Perform validation on API endpoints to ensure data integrity.

## Client Web Application:
 - Place your client-side code within a client folder.
 - Use only plain HTML, JavaScript, and CSSâ€”no frameworks or libraries are allowed.
 - Display a list of all items in the database.
 - Provide detailed views for each item, including edit and delete functionality.
 - Include a form to add new items to the database, comprising at least two fields.
 - Conduct data validation on both the client and server sides.

## Grading Criteria (Total: 100%):
### CSS/UI (30%):
 - The interface should be clean, intuitive, and visually appealing.
 - CSS should avoid redundancy and be efficiently structured.
### JavaScript/HTML (35%):
 - Ensure all HTML for the client application is complete and functional.
 - The client must interact with the API successfully for all CRUD operations.
 - Implement front-end data validation effectively.
### API Endpoints (30%):
 - CRUD operations must be fully implemented using Prisma for database interaction.
 - Endpoints must validate input data and correctly interact with the database.
### Code Quality and Attention to Details (5%):
 - The code must be clean, clear, well-commented, and follow best practices.
 - Naming conventions should be descriptive and meaningful, enhancing code readability.
 - The console should be free of errors, and the code should be efficient.

## Example Applications:
 - Note-taking application
 - Recipe collection system
 - Movie or book review site
 - Personal blog or portfolio

## Expectations:
 - Write effective and optimized code, with functions dedicated to singular tasks.
 - Employ descriptive and meaningful naming for functions and variables.
 - Maintain a clean CSS codebase without unnecessary or duplicate styles.
